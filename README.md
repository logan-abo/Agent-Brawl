# Agent Brawl

The Goal: to create a comprehensive, computer vision driven, AI Agent to play the mobile game Brawl Stars. 

Description of the problem:
The Game consists of two main PvP game modes: 3v3 and a 10 player Free-For-All (FFA). This project currently focuses on the FFA mode as it eliminates the complexities of teammates. The Game is played from a fixed, top down, slightly skewed 3rd person perspective.

Agent Brawl is divided between two main aspects: data and modeling.
